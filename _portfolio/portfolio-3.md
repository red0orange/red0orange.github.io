Task-oriented grasping in real-world settings depends on *how* an object should be grasped (e.g., grasp a knife by its handle to cut fruit; grasp the blade to hand it to a user).

Existing approaches often rely on a pre-built knowledge base, which limits generalization to unseen objects and tasks. We propose a Transformer-based model that leverages **LLM semantic knowledge** for better generalization.
