excerpt: "A multi-view fusion perception module for efficient tabletop object rearrangement from a goal image."

User provides a single **goal image** (a tidy tabletop). The robot rearranges the current cluttered tabletop to match the goal.

We propose a perception module based on a **visual localization** pipeline to associate the goal image with **multi-view observations**, improving system efficiency. Since existing baselines were not open-sourced, we built the dataset and system framework from scratch.
