I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Aerial Robotics Group](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk/) at HKUST, advised by Prof. [Shaojie Shen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=u8Q0_xsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I received my Master's degree from the [IRMV Lab](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Hesheng Wang](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng).

My research interests lie in robotics and autonomous driving, with a focus on generative learning, robust estimation, global localization, and long-term mapping.
