I am **Dehao Huang (黄德豪)**, a Ph.D. candidate at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, in a **joint Ph.D. program with Zhongguancun Academy (ZGCA)**. I am with the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab (RCVLab)](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/) at SUSTech, advised by Prof. [Hong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ) (SUSTech) and Prof. [Yue Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fGv5irIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) (ZGCA).

My research focuses on **robotic manipulation and grasping**. Currently, I am working on **reinforcement learning (RL) for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models**, aiming to enable VLA models to interact autonomously with environments and achieve strong performance in both single-task and multi-task settings.

I aim to be an engineering-oriented researcher, dedicated to applying frontier technologies to solve practical problems.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions.
