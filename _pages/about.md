I am **Dehao Huang (黄德豪)**, a Ph.D. candidate at **Zhongguancun Academy & Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**.
I am with the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Hong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ) and Prof. [Yue Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fGv5irIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research focuses on **robotic manipulation and grasping**. Currently, I am working on **reinforcement learning (RL) for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models**, aiming to enable VLA models to interact autonomously with environments and achieve strong performance in both single-task and multi-task settings.

I aim to be an engineering-oriented researcher, dedicated to applying frontier technologies to solve practical problems.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions.
